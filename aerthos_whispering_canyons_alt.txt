A wide twilight view over a maze of sandstone canyons. Terracotta and ochre walls are striped with dark, glassy seams. Fine dust traces the wind around needle‑thin spires. In shaded cuts, ribbons of cyan and emerald moss glow and pulse, as if carrying the canyons’ whisper. Low in the chasms, silver mist lifts in thin sheets. A thread‑thin rope bridge crosses mid‑frame; two tiny cloaked travelers walk beneath a single amber lantern. Far below, a zigzag of iron pitons with wind chimes marks a switchback path. The upper rock edges catch warm rim‑light while the depths stay cool and blue.
